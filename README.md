This is graphing calculator software for the Nintendo DS. 

At least, that's what I'm going for.

CALculator is my senior thesis for undergrad, and the idea is to make a program that turns a Nintendo DS into a viable graphing calculator alternative. Ideally, this will be equivalent to something like a TI-84 and more than capable of tackling most things a student may encounter before high-level college classes. I wanted to make this to give students (especially those who struggle financially) an opportunity to continue their education without breaking the bank. If the student already has a DS, he can easily download this program and entirely avoid paying an exorbitant price for a name-brand one. If she doesn't already have a DS, she could probabaly still find one for less than the listed price for modern graphing calculators and save money that way.

In addition to the above, this has been a stupendous opportunity for me to dive into concepts like lexing, parsing, representing math (numbers, expressions, operators, etc.) with code, lower-level programming, optimization, and software development, to list a few. At the time of writing, I still have quite a way to go and I've already learned so much. This has been, without a doubt, one of the most challenging projects I've ever done, and shockingly, I've actually really enjoyed working on it. I am very excited to continue development!

Anyway, if you have any degree of interest in this project, feel free to reach out! I'm still a rookie when it comes to writing code for the DS and doing math on a computer, and I would be more than happy to learn more about the subject.
